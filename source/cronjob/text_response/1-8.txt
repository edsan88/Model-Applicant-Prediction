The company satisfies me but not to the extent because somethimes due to the number of workloads there are things that has been put into least priority but its just minimal.I somewhat agree simply because atleast the company that i've been working had contributed new working experience that can help me advancing ym career. no because this company is for young people and want to experience a job. not for long last and stable.Somewhat, because there are more opportunities that will suit my field and expand my knowledge what I've learned during my school days. However, working here is a privileged for me because I've learned a lot!Honestly speaking not all the time because the assigned task is loaded we do not know what will be the first but in positive sides it help to find it easy and how to deal with it.for there are some aspects that may i have to develop as a career man.Not much satisifed with my career developmentnot satisfied at allNeutral
